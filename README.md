Property Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting property prices based on various features. The project involves preprocessing data, training a Linear Regression model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset:

The dataset includes the following columns:

*Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the property.
*Furnishing: Furnishing status of the property (e.g., Furnished, Semi-Furnished).
*Area: Size of the property in square feet.
*Price: Price of the property (target variable).
*bhk: Number of bedrooms in the property.
*Locality: Location of the property.


Methodology:


Utilized machine learning algorithms to create predictive models.
Employed models like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Trees.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.



Objectives:


Predict property prices based on the provided features.
Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms to identify the best model for accurate predictions.



Feel free to explore the code and models used in this repository to understand the prediction process and results.
